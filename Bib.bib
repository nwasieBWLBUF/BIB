  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT We analyze brokerage data and an experiment to test a cognitive dissonance based theory of trading: investors avoid realizing losses because they dislike admitting that past purchases were mistakes, but delegation reverses this effect by allowing the investor to blame the manager instead. Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effectï¿½the propensity to realize past gains more than past lossesï¿½applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors' cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse-disposition effect in funds. Cognitive dissonance provides a unified explanation for apparently contradictory investor behavior across asset classes and has implications for personal investment decisions, mutual fund management, and intermediation.},

Sie sollen Individuen oder Gruppen das Instrumentarium daf{\"u}r liefern, sich ihrer Pr{\"a}ferenzen bewusst zu werden und zwischen den verf{\"u}gbaren Alternativen so zu w{\"a}hlen, dass sie in {\"U}bereinstimmung mit ihren Pr{\"a}ferenzen handeln. Die in den hier interessierenden Entscheidungssituationen --- also Individualentscheidungen, strategischen Interaktionen, kollaborativen Verhandlungsprozessen --- zur Anwendung kommenden Grundverfahren sind durchaus {\"a}hnlich. F{\"u}r einen ersten {\"U}berblick wird daher von den zun{\"a}chst einfach erscheinenden, jedoch schnell anspruchsvoller werdenden einseitigen Entscheidungen ausgegangen.1},
